## Backend endpoints used

Base path: `/api/`

- POST `auth/login`
- POST `prosumers/register`
- GET `prosumers/{nic}`
- PUT `prosumers/{nic}`
- POST `prosumers/{nic}/deactivation-request`
- GET `dashboard/prosumer?nic=...`
- GET `dashboard/operator`
- GET `microgrid-nodes?activeOnly=true`
- GET `energy-slots?availableOnly=true`
- POST `reservations?nic=...`
- GET `reservations/mine?nic=...&search=...&status=...`
- PUT `reservations/{id}?nic=...`
- DELETE `reservations/{id}?nic=...`

## Configure API URL

Edit:
`app/src/main/java/com/smartsolar/microgrid/util/SessionManager.java`

Change:
`BASE_URL`

a) Android Emulator talking to a local PC Kestrel server:
`http://10.0.2.2:PORT/api/`

b) Physical Android phone talking to a PC on the same Wi-Fi:
`http://YOUR_PC_LAN_IP:PORT/api/`

c) IIS HTTPS deployment:
`https://YOUR_SERVER_HOST/api/`

Use the actual port/host exposed by your C# API. Do not leave the placeholder URL for a real run.

## Google Maps

1. Create/configure a Google Maps Android API key.
2. Enable Maps SDK for Android.
3. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
4. The app plots active nodes using latitude/longitude returned by the C# API.

## Android Studio

Open the `SmartSolarMicrogridMobile` folder in Android Studio and let Gradle sync.

Recommended environment:
- Android Studio recent stable version
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35
- Minimum Android 7.0 (API 24)

The project is Java-only and does not use Flutter, React Native, Kotlin Multiplatform, or another cross-platform UI framework.

## Important backend compatibility note

This mobile client is intentionally written against the controllers and DTOs in the supplied SmartSolarMicrogrid C# reference backend. The current backend uses `nic` as a query parameter for Prosumer dashboard/reservation operations, so the mobile client sends that parameter.

The server remains the authority for all business rules. The Android app does not connect to MongoDB directly.

## Demo flow

### Prosumer
Register → Backoffice activates account → Login → Dashboard → choose available slot → create booking → Backoffice approves → My Bookings → Get QR → show QR at station.

### Grid Operator
Login → Dashboard → Scan Prosumer QR → server verifies reservation → Finalize Transfer → reservation becomes Completed.

## Build

Open in Android Studio and run the `app` configuration on an emulator or physical device.

The generated package intentionally does not include Gradle wrapper binaries because this environment cannot download the Gradle distribution. Android Studio can generate/sync the wrapper from the project configuration.
